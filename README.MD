# MirandaBot

This bot posts g'morning and g'night messages from Lin Manuel Miranda from Twitter into a channel on slack

## Configuration

Edit `sample_config.json` and save it as `config.json`. You'll need twitter API keys and slack API keys. Run this somewhere on a schedule; once an hour is probably overkill, twice a day would work.
